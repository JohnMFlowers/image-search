# ImageSearch

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.0.

## Development

Use yarn instead of npm: after cloning the repository, run "yarn" in the project directory to fetch dependencies and populate the node_modules directory.

In order to work properly with the Imgur APIs, the ng server is configured to listen on 0.0.0.0:4200. You'll need to use your client's IP address instead of "localhost"
to access the dev server.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://<client ip address>:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
